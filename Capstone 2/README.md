### Gulf Coast Area Rainfall Prediction
Files include:
Python Jupyter Notebook: contains the full code and visualizations for data cleaning, wrangling, analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
Slide Deck: Presentation of the project in powerpoint form
Our data is from https://ww.ncdc.noaa.gov/ and consists of 5 different datasets from each of our 5 chosen cities along the Gulf Coast. Collected between January 2010 through December 2019. Each dataset consists of daily weather data and is saved as a CSV file

#### Primary Goal
History is known to repeat itself at times but predicting if/when history will repeat itself is an ongoing issue. The best approach is look for patterns of the past while comparing it to patterns of the present. The goal of this project is: Can we predict rainfall for the Gulf Coast area?

We will look at days that had rainfall amounts
We will look at days that didn't have rainfall amounts.
