# Relax_Inc_Challenge

A take home data science challenge from Relax Inc. (anonymized real company). Provided by Springboard Data Science Career Track.

### The  data  has  the  following  two  tables:
1]  A  user  table  ( "takehome_users" )  with  data  on  12,000  users  who  signed  up  for  the
product  in  the  last  two  years. 

2]  A  usage  summary  table  ( "takehome_user_engagement" )  that  has  a  row  for  each  day
that  a  user  logged  into  the  product.


Defining  an  "adopted  user"   as  a  user  who   has  logged  into  the  product  on  three  separate
days  in  at  least  one  sevenÂ­day  period ,  identify  which  factors  predict  future  user
adoption
